# Telemetry System Documentation

This is just an explaination for the OpenTelemetryCollector which we will itterate over 


## 1. Collector Implementation (`collector.go`)

### Overview
The `collector.go` file contains implementations of different types of collectors which handle telemetry data according to the system's requirements. Each collector implements the `Collector` interface, which defines standard operations such as `Initialize`, `HandleEvent`, `Shutdown`, and configuration retrieval methods.

### Collector Types
- **FileCollector**: Logs data to a specified file. (not implemented yet)
- **DatabaseCollector**: Sends data to a configured database endpoint. (not implemented yet)
- **ReputationCollector**: Handles specialized telemetry or reputation data. (not implemented yet)
- **OpenTelemetryCollector**: Sends telemetry data to an OpenTelemetry collector.

### Usage
To use any collector, create an instance of the desired collector type and call its methods to manage telemetry data. For example, to use the `OpenTelemetryCollector`, you would initialize it with the required endpoint configuration.

## 2. Configuration Management (`config.go`)

### Overview
The `config.go` file defines the structure and mechanisms needed to load configuration settings from a YAML file (`config.yaml`). These settings configure various aspects of the system, including database (just as an example) connections, logging levels, and telemetry endpoints.

### Configuration Structure
The configuration file is structured as follows (example):

```yaml
database:
  endpoint: "http://database-url"
  port: 5432
  username: "user"
  password: "password"
logging:
  level: "info"
telemetry:
  service_name: "MyService"
  otel_collector_endpoint: "http://otel-collector:4317"
```


### Functions
- **LoadConfig**: This function reads the `config.yaml`, parses it into the `Config` struct, and returns it for use throughout the application.

## 3. Main Application (`main.go`)

### Implementation
The `main.go` file serves as the entry point for the application. It is responsible for loading the configuration using `config.go` and initializing the necessary collectors based on the loaded configuration.

### Example Implementation

```go
package main

import (
    "context"
    "fmt"
    "telemetry"
    "telemetry/config"
)

func main() {
    ctx := context.Background()
    cfg, err := config.LoadConfig("./config.yaml")
    if err != nil {
        fmt.Println("Error loading config:", err)
        return
    }

    collector, err := telemetry.NewOpenTelemetryCollector(ctx, &cfg.Telemetry)
    if err != nil {
        fmt.Println("Error initializing telemetry collector:", err)
        return
    }

}
```

### Process Flow
1. Load the configuration from `config.yaml`.
2. Initialize the appropriate collectors.
3. Use these collectors within our application logic to handle telemetry data effectively.
