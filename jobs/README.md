# Introduction

Jobs package will manage local jobs and their allocation, including relation to execution environments, etc. It will manage jobs through whatever executor it's running (Vontainer, VM, Direct_exe, Java etc).

## Types and data models

### Allocation

As per initial [specification of NuNet ontology / nomenclature](https://nunet.gitlab.io/research/blog/posts/ontology-and-nomenclature/#actors), `Allocation` extend the `models.Actor` interface and by that makes the running job a first class citizen of NuNet's Actor model, so being able to send and receive messages and maintain state.
