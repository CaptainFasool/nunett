// StorageProvider handles I/O operations of files with remote storage providers
// such as AWS S3 and IPFS.
//
// Its functionality is coupled with local mounted volumes, meaning that implementations
// will rely on mounted files to upload data and downloading data will result in a
// local mounted volume.
//
// - When needed, the availability-checking (e.g.: check if IPFS node is running) of some
// storage provider is handled when instantiating the implementation
//
// - Any necessary authentication data is also provided within the `*models.SpecConfig`
// parameters
//
// - Although it may be feasible to implement, the interface was not built with
// the idea of supporting streaming of data and non-file storage operations (e.g.:
// some databases)

	// Download downloads data from a given source, mounting it to a certain local path
	// which is defined by the VolumeController being used.
