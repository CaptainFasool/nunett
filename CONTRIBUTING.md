# Contributing guidelines

Author: @janaina.senna

This page contains guidelines for community to contribute in NuNet's development by reporting bugs and suggesting improvements. [This GitLab tutorial](https://forum.gitlab.com/t/report-a-bug/40232/1) was used as inspiration to create this page.

## How to report a bug?

:bug: Bug reports should be submitted to the [**issue tracker.**](https://gitlab.com/nunet/documentation/-/issues)

:bug: Bugs should be reproducible! If you are unsure if what you are experiencing is reproducible, [reach out to our community](TBD) and ask a friend to help you reproduce what you need in order to confirm!

:bug: [Always search the Issue Tracker FIRST](https://gitlab.com/nunet/documentation/-/issues/?label_name=type::bug)! It’s likely someone caught this before you, or already reported something similar, and it will save time and effort. If you find an existing issue, show your support with an award emoji and/or join the discussion.

:bug: [Use the Bug Issue Template](https://gitlab.com/nunet/documentation/-/blob/main/.gitlab/issue_templates/Bug.md)! This template is provided on the issue tracker linked above. You can copy-paste, and then edit as you see fit. The text in the comments (`<!-- ... -->`) is there to help you with what to include.

:bug: Add the ~type::bug label to your issue!


## How to request a new feature?

:star2: Feature proposals should be submitted to the [**issue tracker**](https://gitlab.com/nunet/documentation/-/issues).

:star2: Keep it simple! Keep feature proposals as small and simple as possible, complex ones might be edited to make them small and simple.

## Specifying and documenting the contributed code

* All code and contributions have to include appropriate documentation updates, corresponding to the code changes, as explained in [architecture/technical-documentation](https://gitlab.com/nunet/architecture/-/blob/develop/technical-documentation);
* Additionally, the code can include user documentation, as explained in [architecture/user-documenattion](https://gitlab.com/nunet/architecture/-/tree/develop/user-documentation);
