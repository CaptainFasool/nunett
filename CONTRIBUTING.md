## How to report a bug?

:bug: Bug reports should be submitted to the [**issue tracker.**](https://gitlab.com/nunet/documentation/-/issues)

:bug: Bugs should be reproducible! If you are unsure if what you are experiencing is reproducible, [reach out to our community](TBD) and ask a friend to help you reproduce what you need in order to confirm!

:bug: [Always search the Issue Tracker FIRST](https://gitlab.com/nunet/documentation/-/issues/?label_name=type::bug)! It’s likely someone caught this before you, or already reported something similar, and it will save time and effort. If you find an existing issue, show your support with an award emoji and/or join the discussion.

:bug: [Use the Bug Issue Template](https://gitlab.com/nunet/documentation/-/blob/main/.gitlab/issue_templates/Bug.md)! This template is provided on the issue tracker linked above. You can copy-paste, and then edit as you see fit. The text in the comments (`<!-- ... -->`) is there to help you with what to include.

:bug: Add the ~type::bug label to your issue!

Note: [This GitLab tutorial](https://forum.gitlab.com/t/report-a-bug/40232/1) was used as inspiration to create this section.


## How to request a new feature?
