	// Run initiates and waits for the completion of an execution for the given ExecutionRequest.
	// It returns a ExecutionResult and an error if any part of the operation fails.

	// It returns two channels:
	// 1. A channel that emits the execution result once the task is complete.
	// 2. An error channel that relays any issues encountered, such as when the
	//    execution is non-existent or has already concluded.
	Wait(ctx context.Context, executionID string) (<-chan *models.ExecutionResult, <-chan error)

	// Cancel attempts to cancel an ongoing execution identified by its executionID.
	// Returns an error if the execution does not exist or is already in a terminal state.
	Cancel(ctx context.Context, executionID string) error

	// GetLogStream provides a stream of output for an ongoing or completed execution identified by its executionID.
	// The 'Tail' flag indicates whether to exclude hstorical data or not.
	// The 'follow' flag indicates whether the stream should continue to send data as it is produced.
	// Returns an io.ReadCloser to read the output stream and an error if the operation fails.
	// Specifically, it will return an error if the execution does not exist.
